https://JimFawcett.github.io/RustBiteByByte.html - RustBites documentation

## Contents:

Content of this repository is evolving rapidly.  The documentation (link above) contains brief bites of "getting started" definitions, examples, and exercises for those beginning to learn Rust.

The intent is that each bite will contain a small number of pages in some tightly focused area, and may, eventually
be accompanied by a 10 to 15 minute video.

Visit the link, above for access to existing materials and a preview of what's to come.

Some of the sample code from the bytes is stored in this repository.  That is migrating to playground links found here:
- <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/RustPlaygroundExamples">RustPlaygroundExamples</a>
- <a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/IndexPage.html">Glossary</a>

## Sample:

<a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/Resources/RustBites/RustBites_Safety.html">Memory Safety</a>

See RustBites documentation link above for complete list of Bites.
