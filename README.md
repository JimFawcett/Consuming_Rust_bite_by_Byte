## Contents:

    Work just beginning on this repository - please stop by later.

    This repository will contain brief bites of "getting started" definitions, examples, and exercises for those
    beginning the Rust journey.

    The intent is that each bite will contain a small number of pages in some tightly focused area, and may, eventually
    be accompanied by a 10 to 15 minute video.

 ### A sequence of short stories (Bites) about Rust, the programming language:
  
1. [**data**](#data-1)

    Explains binding, copy, move, and clone.

2. **undefined behavior**

    Gives an example of UDB in non-idiomatic C++ and shows that can't happen in Rust

3. **ownership**

    Explains mutability, single ownership, borrows, and Rust ownership reader-write lock behavior

4. functions
5. error handling
6. structs
7. traits
8. generics
9. lifetime annotations
10. abstractions
11. collections
12. iterators
13. threads
14. synchronization
15. message passing
16. async await
17. thread-safe sharing
18. macros
