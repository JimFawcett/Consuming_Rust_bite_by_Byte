## Contents:

Content of this repository is evolving rapidly.  The documentation (link above) contains brief bites of "getting started" definitions, examples, and exercises for those beginning to learn Rust.

The intent is that each bite will contain a small number of pages in some tightly focused area, and may, eventually
be accompanied by a 10 to 15 minute video.

Visit the link, above for access to existing materials and a preview of what's to come.

All the sample code from the bytes is stored in this repository.
